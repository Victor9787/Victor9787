Hello to you! 🫶

I'm Victor, I am passionate about software engineering, especially building applications with Jatpack Compose!
I do most of my projects for myself, so they are in private repositories.

Apart from that, I am an amateur in electronics and working with Arduino. I am studying C++.

Fun facts:
  • I like chess
  • Chopin ❤️
  • I don't read self-development books
